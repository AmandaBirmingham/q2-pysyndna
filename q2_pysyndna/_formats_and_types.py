# "Currently QIIME 2 requires that all formats registered to a Semantic Type
# be a directory format .... For [single file format] cases, there exists a
# factory for quickly constructing directory layouts that contain only a
# single file. This requirement might be removed in the future, but for now it
# is a necessary evil (and also isnâ€™t too much extra work for format
# developers)."
